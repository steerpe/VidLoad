# Installation guide
once you have the product working, start explaining how to install it (at the moment i don't have any idea of how to do this, if there will be an .exe file at the end or if you need to use the command line)

First thing is to make the product work with command line and then develop a GUI.
No one will have installing issues now, i will think about it later.
